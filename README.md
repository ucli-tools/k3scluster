## Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for deploying and managing a Highly Available (HA) Kubernetes (K3s) cluster using Tailscale for secure networking. It simplifies the process of setting up a robust, multi-node Kubernetes cluster with automated deployment, application deployment (NGINX example), and efficient cleanup procedures.

## Features

- **Automated Deployment:** Streamlined setup of a multi-node K3s cluster with multiple control plane and worker nodes.
- **Tailscale Integration:** Leverages Tailscale for secure and reliable communication between cluster nodes.
- **High Availability:** Ensures cluster resilience with multiple control plane nodes.
- **NGINX Deployment Example:** Includes an example for deploying and exposing an NGINX application with Ingress controllers for high availability and load balancing.
- **Automated Cleanup:** Provides scripts for cleaning up the application and the entire cluster, simplifying removal and redeployment.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed logging with color-coded output for easy monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Makefile Driven:** Uses a Makefile to organize and execute various deployment and cleanup tasks.

## Architecture

The cluster consists of:

- **Control Plane Nodes:** Multiple K3s server nodes forming the control plane for managing the cluster.
- **Worker Nodes:**  Nodes where workloads (like the NGINX deployment) are scheduled.
- **Tailscale Network:**  Provides a secure mesh network for communication between all nodes.
- **NGINX Deployment:**  Example application deployed as a Deployment with multiple replicas for high availability.
- **Ingress Controllers:**  Multiple Ingress controllers distributed across worker nodes for load balancing and high availability of the NGINX application.


## Prerequisites

1. **Local Machine:** Ubuntu 24.04 with:
   - `kubectl`
   - `helm`
   - `curl`
   - `ssh`
   - `jq` (optional, for JSON parsing)

   These will be installed automatically if not present.

2. **Cluster Configuration File:**  `ha_cluster.txt` (See `ha_cluster_template.txt` for an example and copy it to `ha_cluster.txt`  with your node details).  This file defines the IP addresses and usernames for your control plane and worker nodes.

3. **SSH Access:**
   - Passwordless SSH access to all nodes using an SSH key (default: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
   - SSH public key added to each node's `authorized_keys`.

4. **Node Requirements:**
   - Passwordless `sudo` access on all nodes.
   - Tailscale installed and running on all nodes.
   - Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux distribution recommended.


## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mik-tf/k3scluster.git
   cd k3scluster
   ```

2. **Configure the cluster:**

   ```bash
   cp ha_cluster_template.txt ha_cluster.txt
   # Edit ha_cluster.txt with your node details (Tailscale IPs and usernames)
   ```

3. **Deploy the cluster:**

   ```bash
   make cluster
   ```

4. **Deploy the NGINX application:**

    ```bash
    make app-nginx
    ```


## Makefile Targets

The Makefile provides the following targets:

- `make cluster`: Deploys the HA K3s cluster.
- `make app-nginx`: Deploys the NGINX application with Ingress controllers.
- `make clean-cluster`: Cleans up the K3s cluster.
- `make clean-app`: Cleans up the NGINX application.
- `make help`: Displays help information about the Makefile targets.

## Script Workflow

### hacluster.sh Workflow

1. **Initialization:** Displays script description and prompts for confirmation.
2. **Prerequisite Check:** Verifies and installs necessary tools on the local machine.
3. **Cluster Configuration:** Parses `ha_cluster.txt` and validates node information.
4. **Connectivity Test:** Checks SSH and Tailscale connectivity to all nodes.
5. **K3s Installation:** Installs and configures K3s on control plane and worker nodes.
6. **Cluster Verification:** Waits for nodes to become ready and labels worker nodes.
7. **Output:** Displays the cluster status.


### app_nginx.sh Workflow

1. **Initialization:**  Displays script description and logs the start of the NGINX deployment.
2. **Cluster Information:** Parses the `ha_cluster.txt` file to get node information.
3. **MagicDNS Domain:** Prompts the user for their Tailscale MagicDNS domain (e.g., `example.ts.net`).
4. **NGINX Deployment Creation:** Creates a Kubernetes Deployment for NGINX with 3 replicas.
5. **LoadBalancer Service:** Creates a LoadBalancer Service to expose the NGINX deployment.  Uses the Tailscale IPs of the worker nodes as `externalIPs`.
6. **Ingress Controller Installation:**
    - Installs `helm`.
    - Sets up `kubeconfig` to communicate with the cluster.
    - Installs the `ingress-nginx` controller on each worker node, configuring them for high availability and assigning different ingress classes.
7. **Verification:** Checks the status of the NGINX pods, services, and ingress classes.
8. **Access Information:** Prints the URLs that can be used to access the NGINX application, including Tailscale IPs and MagicDNS names.
9. **URL Accessibility Test:** Tests the accessibility of the provided URLs using `curl` and displays a summary table with status codes and latency.

## Cleanup

Use the following Makefile targets for cleanup:

- **`make clean-app`**: Removes the NGINX deployment, services, ingress controllers, and related resources.
- **`make clean-cluster`**: Completely removes the K3s cluster from all nodes.
